<section class="document-content">
    <article class="article-content"><p>To write the first set of questions users may ask means you understand their
        needs.</p>
        <p>We generally think we know what users need, since in our industry we have always tried to play the role of
            user representative.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Understanding these needs may require involving test users and support in information design. Using edc,
            especially for contextual help, means we don't over-write and build information step by step.&nbsp;</p>

    <article class="article-content"><h2>Why write questions and answers at all?</h2>
        <p>Taking users on a journey is about stimulating their reading. This changes the way we need to write for
            them.</p>
        <p>It will also encourage them to return questions, via support, that can be incorporated into an evolving set
            of help.</p></article>
