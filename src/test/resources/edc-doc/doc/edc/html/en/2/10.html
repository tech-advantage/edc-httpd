<h2 class="title"> Adding contextualised help to a UI brick</h2>
<section class="document-content">
    <article class="article-content"><p>The key concept in designing contextualised UI brick help is <strong><span
            data-glossary="78" class="span-glossary"><abbr
            title="Short piece of user help accessible from and designed to be used with the interface."
            class="glossary">context</abbr></span></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Think of a user in their particular context. Write for the most typical user of the brick in question. Keep
            it very short. You can add links to pertinent information in the other documentation types, how-tos,
            concepts, training, etc. This lets you stage&nbsp;the reading experience.</p>
        <p>Although six article types are provided, the best strategy is to use one or two. This forces you to think of
            the type of content which is the most pertinent. If you end up wanting to use all six types, maybe you will
            need to talk to developers about where the documentation access is made available, or about the the
            ergonomics and clarity of the UI.</p></article>
